Practical 11: Interfaces and Default Interface Methods
1. Define an interface "Shape" with methods for area and perimeter.
2. Implement the "Shape" interface in classes like "Rectangle" and "Circle".
3. Create another interface "Resizable" with a default resizing method.
4. Implement this interface in the "Rectangle" class and demonstrate the use of the default
method.
5. Implement multiple interfaces in a class and showcase method usage from both interfaces.
